# Big headline of task

## Description: 
**Context**: Context for problem/task

**Problem/Task**: Problem/task being tackled

**Solution/Result**: Solution/Result completed

**Implication**: Implication now that this solution/result exists

## Engineer Concerns:

**Prior relevant experience**:

**Doing for first time**:

**Lessons Learned**:

**Engineering constraints**:

**Complexity factors**:
- How to prove work is done?: How can you demonstrate work was done in a clear black and white manner? If this is complex chances are your work is going to be complex because of this bottleneck
- Domain Changes?: Do you have to change the assumptions the codebase's domain has? What are they if you do?
- Event Changes?: Do you have to change the events that happen in the overall ecosystem? What are they if you do?
- System Changes?: Do you have to change the actual system that exist in the ecosystem? What changes if you do?
